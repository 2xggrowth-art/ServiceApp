## 🔍 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

- **Clear Financial Justification:** ₹92K monthly pain → ₹3L solution pays for itself in 4 months
- **Personal Commitment:** You've maintained discipline (store operations) and committed to daily use
- **Realistic Timeline:** 13 weeks aligns with framework recommendations
- **Motivated Team:** Mechanics also suffer from blame games, will appreciate fair system
- **Scalable Problem:** Other bicycle shops likely have same pain (future SaaS potential)

### ⚠️ Watch Out For:
