## PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This is a filter. 

If you can't answer these questions clearly, you're not ready to build anything.

Most software projects fail because these questions weren't answered honestly.

**Instructions:**
1. Answer every question
2. Be brutally honest (no one else sees this)
3. If you can't answer → you need to research first
4. Share your answers with your developer friend AFTER completing this

**Time to complete:** 1-2 hours

## PART 1: THE PROBLEM (Must answer all)

### Q1: What is the ONE problem you're solving?

**Write in 2-3 sentences max, no tech terms:**

[Example: "I forget to follow up with customers. They go cold because I don't call back at the right time. This costs me sales."]

YOUR ANSWER:
I cannot properly manage my service team of 5-6 mechanics at Bharath Cycle Hub. I don't know who is performing well, who solves the most issues, or how to set targets for them. This causes blame games between staff, inconsistent pricing quotes to customers, and I'm losing 2-3 customers every weekend (₹6K-9K revenue loss) due to poor service management and long wait times.


**Follow-up: Is this ONE problem or multiple problems disguised as one?**

[ ] This is truly ONE problem
[X] This is actually multiple problems → If checked, pick THE MOST PAINFUL one and focus there

**NOTE: While we have issues with communication, pricing, quality control, and workflow - the ROOT cause is lack of mechanic performance management. Everything else stems from this.**


---

### Q2: How frequently does this problem hit you?

**Select ONE:**

[X] Multiple times per day
[ ] Once per day
[ ] 2-3 times per week
[ ] Once per week
[ ] Once per month
[ ] Randomly / Unpredictably

**Why this matters:**
- If "Multiple times per day" → Extremely painful, worth solving ✓
- If "Once per week" or less → May not be painful enough to sustain building

**Follow-up: Has this frequency increased recently?**

[X] Yes - it's getting worse (why: Business scaling from 500-600 bikes/month, weekend rush is causing chaos)
[ ] No - it's been consistent
[ ] No - it's actually decreasing

**If frequency is decreasing → Why are you solving this now?**

N/A - Frequency is increasing with business growth


---

### Q3: Why are you solving this NOW?

**What changed in the last 3-6 months that made this problem urgent?**

[Example: "My business grew from 20 leads/month to 100 leads/month. Old manual method doesn't scale."]

YOUR ANSWER:
Our business has scaled significantly - we're selling 500-600 bikes monthly now, up from much smaller numbers before. The old book-and-pen system worked when we were smaller, but now with 5-6 mechanics and heavy weekend traffic, I'm losing control. Every weekend we lose 2-3 customers (₹6-9K revenue) because of long wait times and poor coordination. Plus, the blame games and inconsistent pricing are damaging our reputation.

**If nothing changed:**
Why didn't you solve this 6 months ago? What's different now?

6 months ago, the volume was lower and I could personally manage everything. Now the scale has exceeded my personal ability to track everything manually.


---

### Q4: What's the financial cost of NOT solving this?

**You must quantify. Take 10 minutes to calculate:**

**Lost Revenue per Month:** ₹ 30,000

**How did you calculate this?**
Weekend customer loss: 2-3 customers/weekend × 4 weekends × ₹3000 profit/customer = ₹24,000-36,000
Plus occasional returns/quality issues affecting reputation = ₹30,000/month conservative estimate

**Wasted Time per Week:** 8 hours

**Your hourly rate:** ₹ 1,000

**Monthly cost of wasted time:** ₹ 32,000 (8 hours/week × 4 weeks × ₹1,000)

**Other Costs:**
- Lost opportunities: ₹ 10,000 (potential upsells missed due to poor service)
- Stress/health impact: ₹ 5,000 (estimate)
- Team inefficiency: ₹ 15,000 (blame games, rework, mistakes)

**TOTAL MONTHLY COST:** ₹ 92,000

**CRITICAL DECISION POINT:**

If total monthly cost < ₹10,000:
→ Problem may not be worth building a custom system for
→ Consider buying existing solution or tolerating the problem

If total monthly cost > ₹10,000: ✓
→ Problem is expensive enough to justify building

**Your decision:**
[X] Cost is high enough (>₹10,000/month) → Continue
[ ] Cost is low (<₹10,000/month) → Should I really build this?


---

### Q5: What have you already tried?

**List every solution you've attempted:**

| Solution | Duration Used | Why It Failed |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Book and pen system | 2+ years | Data fragmented, can't analyze performance, blame games after customers leave |
| Verbal communication only | Ongoing | Mechanics forget promises to customers, no accountability |
| Standard ₹500 overtime pay | 1+ year | No motivation for difficult jobs, cherry-picking on weekends |
| Zoho for invoicing only | 6 months | Only handles billing, no service tracking or team management |

**Pattern check:**
Look at "Why It Failed" column. Do you see a pattern?

Common patterns:
- "Required too much discipline" → You need automated system
- "Too complex" → You need dead-simple system
- "Forgot to use it" → You need aggressive notifications
- "Manual data entry" → You need auto-capture

**What pattern do you see?**
All solutions lack TRACKING and ACCOUNTABILITY. I need a system that automatically captures performance data and prevents people from forgetting commitments. Manual tracking doesn't work at our scale.


---

## PART 2: YOUR COMMITMENT (Be honest)

### Q6: Will you actually use this daily?

**Honest self-assessment:**

In the last 12 months, have you maintained ANY system/habit for 30+ consecutive days?

[X] Yes - I'm disciplined (give example: Daily store operations management, consistent 6 AM opening for 2+ years)
[ ] No - I struggle with consistency

**If NO:**
Your system MUST have:
- Auto-notifications
- Forgiveness for skipped days
- Minimal manual input
- Visible immediate value

**Daily usage commitment:**

"I commit to using this system every single day for 30 days straight, starting from [DATE: March 1, 2026]"

[X] I can commit to this
[ ] I'm not sure I can commit → If checked, don't build yet


---

### Q7: How much time will you invest?

**Building a working system requires time FROM YOU, not just developer.**

**Can you commit to:**

- Week 1: 8-10 hours (problem definition)
  [X] YES [ ] NO

- Weeks 2-8: 2-3 hours per week (testing iterations)
  [X] YES [ ] NO

- Weeks 9-12: 30 mins per day (using the system)
  [X] YES [ ] NO

**If you answered NO to any:**
You're not ready. Don't waste developer's time.

**NOTES:** As business owner, I already spend more than this time dealing with current problems. This is actually time-saving investment.


---

### Q8: What's your pain tolerance?

**Rate yourself 1-10:**

1 = "I abandon tools after one bug"
10 = "I'll tolerate bugs if it solves my problem"

**Your pain tolerance:** 7 / 10

**If 1-4:**
→ You need polished MVP before using
→ Will require more iterations
→ Not ready for vibe coding approach

**If 5-7:** ✓
→ Can handle rough edges
→ Good fit for vibe coding

**If 8-10:**
→ High tolerance
→ Can start using even incomplete version

**NOTES:** I deal with bike repair issues daily, so I can handle software bugs if it solves the core problem.


---

## PART 3: STAKEHOLDER REALITY

### Q9: Who will use this system daily?

**Select ONE:**

[ ] Just me
[X] Me + my team (6-8 people)
[ ] My team only (I won't use it daily)
[ ] External customers

**If "Me + my team" or "My team only":**

**Lowest tech skill level in team (1-10):** 4

Where 1 = "barely uses smartphone" and 10 = "developer"

**If lowest skill < 5:** ✓
→ System must be EXTREMELY simple
→ No complex workflows
→ Mobile-first design mandatory

**TEAM BREAKDOWN:**
- Me (owner): Tech skill 8
- Mujju (senior mech): Tech skill 5  
- Appi (junior mech): Tech skill 6
- Baba, Mohan, Iqbal (other mechs): Tech skill 3-4
- Support staff (2-3): Tech skill 4-5


---

### Q10: Who pays for this?

**Select ONE:**

[X] I pay from my own/business budget
[ ] My company pays (I need to justify ROI)
[ ] We plan to charge customers (it's part of product)

**If "My company pays":**
Who do you need to convince? N/A - I own the business

What ROI do they need to see? N/A

---

### Q11: Who feels the most pain?

**Be honest:**

[X] I feel the pain most
[ ] My employee/team feels it most
[ ] My customer feels it most

**If pain owner ≠ user:**

This is a RED FLAG. Example:
- You feel the pain (lose sales)
- Your sales rep uses the system daily
- Sales rep doesn't feel the pain (they get paid anyway)

**Result:** Sales rep won't use it diligently.

**Mitigation strategy if different people:**
In our case, I feel the financial pain but mechanics will use the system daily. However, they also feel pain (blame games, unfair compensation, unclear expectations) so they're motivated to use a system that makes their work life better.


---

## PART 4: SYSTEM VIABILITY

### Q12: Can you describe the system in one sentence?

**Write ONE sentence that completes this:**

"This system will [ACTION] so that [OUTCOME]."

[Example: "This system will automatically remind me to follow up with customers so that I never lose a sale due to forgetting."]

YOUR ANSWER:
This system will automatically track mechanic performance and assign service jobs so that I can eliminate blame games, ensure fair compensation, reduce customer wait times, and prevent weekend revenue loss.

**If you needed more than one sentence → system is too complex, simplify.**

**NOTES:** This clearly states the action (track performance + assign jobs) and the outcome (eliminate issues + prevent losses).


---

### Q13: What happens if you DON'T build this?

**One year from now, if this problem continues:**

**Financial impact:**
Lost revenue: ₹ 11,04,000 (monthly cost ₹92,000 × 12)

**Personal impact:**
[X] Stressed/burned out
[X] Lost business opportunities  
[X] Team frustration
[ ] No impact (then why build?)

**Competitive impact:**
[X] Competitors will outpace me
[X] I'll lose market share
[ ] No competitive impact

**ADDITIONAL NOTES:** At our scale (500-600 bikes/month), poor service management will compound. Reputation damage could reduce monthly sales by 10-20%, which could mean additional ₹3-6 lakh monthly revenue loss beyond the direct costs calculated.


---

### Q14: Build, Buy, or Tolerate?

**Research existing solutions (spend 1 hour Googling):**

**Existing tools that solve similar problems:**

| Tool Name | Price/Month | Why NOT Using It |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| Generic Service Management Software | ₹5,000-15,000 | Too complex, designed for large companies, doesn't handle bicycle-specific workflows |
| Employee Management Apps | ₹2,000-8,000 | No service tracking, no customer management integration |
| CRM + Service Tools | ₹10,000+ | Overkill, has 50+ features we don't need, expensive |

**Cost comparison (12 months):**

| Option | Total Cost | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------------|------|------|
| **Tolerate** | ₹11,04,000 (lost revenue) | No effort | Bleeding money, reputation damage |
| **Buy Generic Tool** | ₹1,20,000 (₹10K/month) | Quick start | Too complex, doesn't fit our workflow, ongoing costs |
| **Build Custom** | ₹3,00,000 (dev cost estimate) | Perfect fit, one-time cost, ownership | Time investment, development risk |

**Your decision:**
[X] BUILD - because: Custom solution will pay for itself in 3-4 months through saved revenue. Long-term ownership without recurring fees. Perfect fit for bicycle service business workflow.
[ ] BUY - which tool: ________________________________________
[ ] TOLERATE - why: _________________________________________

## PART 5: SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Q15: How will you know it's working?

**Define success in measurable terms:**

**Current state:**
- Time spent on [service management]: 8 hours/week
- Revenue lost to [poor service management]: ₹ 92,000 /month
- Stress level (1-10): 8

**Target state (after 30 days of using system):**
- Time spent on [service management]: 2 hours/week
- Revenue lost to [poor service management]: ₹ 20,000 /month
- Stress level (1-10): 4

**If targets aren't 50%+ improvement → not worth building.**

✓ Time saved: 75% improvement (8→2 hours/week)
✓ Revenue saved: 78% improvement (₹92K→₹20K/month)  
✓ Stress reduced: 50% improvement (8→4/10)

All targets exceed 50% improvement threshold.


---

### Q16: What's your deadline?

**When do you need this working?**

**MVP (basic version):** [DATE: May 15, 2026]

**Why this date?**
Summer season starts in June with higher bicycle demand. We need the system working before peak season to handle increased volume without losing customers.

**Is this realistic?**

Rule of thumb: MVP = 8-12 weeks for simple system

[X] My deadline is realistic (12+ weeks)
[ ] My deadline is aggressive (4-8 weeks) → Reduce scope
[ ] My deadline is impossible (<4 weeks) → Reset expectations

**TIMELINE BREAKDOWN:**
- Start: February 15, 2026
- MVP target: May 15, 2026  
- Total time: 13 weeks (realistic for this system)


---

## PART 6: MARKET POTENTIAL (If you plan to sell)

### Q17: Do you want to sell this?

**Select ONE:**

[ ] NO - Private internal tool for my business only
[ ] MAYBE - If it works well for me, I'll consider selling
[ ] YES - I want to build this as a product to sell

**If NO:**
Skip questions 18-20, you're done.

**If MAYBE or YES:**
Answer questions 18-20.


---

### Q18: Who else has this exact problem?

**Think of 5 specific people/companies:**

1. _____________________________ (Name/Company)
2. _____________________________ (Name/Company)
3. _____________________________ (Name/Company)
4. _____________________________ (Name/Company)
5. _____________________________ (Name/Company)

**For each person, answer:**
- Do they have the SAME problem frequency as you? (daily/weekly)
- Do they have the SAME pain level as you? (₹ lost/month)
- Do they have the SAME tech skill as you?

**If you can't name 5 specific people:**
→ Market may be too small
→ Keep it private for now


---

### Q19: Would YOU pay for this if you didn't build it?

**Honest answer:**

"If someone else built this exact solution, I would pay ₹ _______ /month for it."

**Why this price?**
_____________________________________________________________________________

**What's the MAXIMUM you'd pay?** ₹ _______ /month

**If your max is < ₹500/month:**
→ Market value is low
→ Hard to build sustainable business
→ Consider keeping it private


---

### Q20: Are you an accurate proxy for the market?

**Answer honestly:**

Do you have HIGHER or LOWER than average:

| Characteristic | Higher | Average | Lower |
|----------------|--------|---------|-------|
| Tech skill | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Pain tolerance | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Discipline | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |
| Available time | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

**If you checked "Higher" for 2+ characteristics:**
→ You're NOT a good proxy for the market
→ What works for you may not work for others
→ You'll need to simplify significantly before selling

**If you checked "Lower" for 2+ characteristics:**
→ You ARE a good proxy
→ If it works for you, it will work for market


---

## FINAL DECISION MATRIX

### Based on your answers above:

**Count your answers:**

**RED FLAGS (Don't build yet):**
- [ ] Monthly cost < ₹10,000 (Q4) → We have ₹92,000 monthly cost ✓
- [ ] Can't commit to daily use (Q6) → I can commit ✓

---

**REMEMBER:**

Your developer can build anything you clearly define.

Your developer CANNOT build what you haven't clearly thought through.

This worksheet forces you to think through BEFORE you start.

Most failed software projects skipped this step.

Don't skip it.
